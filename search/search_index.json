Before that, I had some resistance against containerization. Compared to VM, I saw VMs more secure and isolated. But now I have a different opinion. Although some of the security concerns about containers are true, at least for now, the benefits of containers are more appealing to me now. I have started using Docker wherever I can in my job or even personal life. I use Docker to build my automated security testing platform at work, and I use them to integrate my security testing tools. I run my services such as OpenVPN and Plex on Docker at home. They are everywhere in my life.</p> <p>I would not say I like to use Kali Linux because of 1. I am not particularly eager to run VM all the time. 2. Kali Linux is bloated. 3. There are so many tools that I don\u2019t even use. Instead, I use Arch Linux as my daily driver with a minimum number of packages installed. I use the Blackarch strap on my Arch Linux to get security tools or build the tools on Docker. One of the tools that I use is Metasploit Framework, and thanks to the Rapid7 team, there is a docker for MSF, which is getting updates every day or even sometimes twice a day.

This convenient trick can save you time and streamline your workflow. Let's delve into the process of setting it up.</p> <p>To enable Touch ID for <code>sudo</code>, follow these steps:</p> <ol> <li> <p>Open the Terminal application on your Mac.</p> </li> <li> <p>Type the following command to open the <code>sudo</code> PAM configuration file using the <code>vim</code> text editor: <pre><code>sudo vim /etc/pam.d/sudo\n</code></pre></p> </li> <li>Add the following line at the top of the file: <pre><code>auth sufficient pam_tid.so\n</code></pre> This line enables Touch ID authentication for <code>sudo</code> commands.</li> <li>If you use TMUX, you'll need to attach the PAM (Pluggable Authentication Module) to TMUX to ensure that the Touch ID integration works within TMUX sessions. To do this, follow these additional steps:<ul> <li>Install <code>pam-reattach</code> using Homebrew by running the following command:  <pre><code>brew install pam-reattach\n</code></pre></li> <li>Open the <code>sudo</code> PAM configuration file again:  <pre><code>sudo vim /etc/pam.d/sudo\n</code></pre></li> <li>Add the following line below the previous line:  <pre><code>auth optional /opt/homebrew/lib/pam/pam_reattach.so\n</code></pre> These lines enable Touch ID support within TMUX sessions as well.</li> </ul> </li> <li>Save the changes to the file.</li> <li>You might need to reboot your Mac or restart any open Terminal or TMUX sessions for the changes to take effect.</li> </ol> <p>Here's a convenient script that automates these steps for you:</p> <pre><code>#!/usr/bin/env bash\nset -o nounset # Treat unset variables as an error\n\n# This script is going to add touch id to sudo command, including inside TMUX\n\necho \"NOTICE: you need to install pam-reattach to use it in TMUX\"\n\nsudo_path=\"/etc/pam.d/sudo\"\nchmod 644 $sudo_path\nsed -i -e '2s/^/auth\\t   sufficient\\t  pam_tid.so\\n/' $sudo_path\nsed -i -e '3s/^/auth\\t   optional\\t  \\/opt\\/homebrew\\/lib\\/pam\\/pam_reattach.so\\n/' $sudo_path\nchmod 444 $sudo_path\n</code></pre> <p>Just execute this script in your Terminal, and it will handle the necessary configurations for you.</p> <p>With Touch ID-enabled <code>sudo</code>, you can now perform administrative tasks more conveniently and securely. This feature not only eliminates the need to type your password but also enhances the overall accessibility of your Mac.
