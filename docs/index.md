# Nima Saed
## Ethical Hacker, Software Security Engineer, DevSecOps Engineer

I am a security consultant at [Xebia Security](https://xebia.com) in the Netherlands.

I have worked in the IT industry for 19 years and in the security field for the past eight years, mainly as a software security engineer and ethical hacker.

I have studied security technology and applied cryptography. I have a deep knowledge of software security, encryption, and signature, which makes it very helpful to develop and pen-test software components such as authentication and authorisation.

I have worked in the medical, education, metal, and software industries, and each has its unique privacy and security challenges. But I always have one common goal among all industries: introducing the security processes as enablers, not blockers, and automation and simplicity were always at the core.
